                        This is another attempt at "Sounds-draw," inspired by Chopin's "Fantaisie-Impromptu in C-sharp minor." The tumultuous and brooding waves depict the swirling sensation and wildness of the first theme, while the distant angelic light represents the soaring sensation above the clouds, akin to the second theme.</td>

                        This is an ongoing experimental series where I attempt to translate music into visuals, which I call "Sounds-draw". This particular artwork was completed in 2019, taking approximately two months to finish, using watercolor pencils exclusively for coloring.The color scheme of this painting was inspired by Chopin's 21 Nocturnes, with my personal favorite plant, the Yellow Water Lily (scientific name: Nuphar shimadai Hayata), serving as the main subject. I used unreal colors to convey the nocturnes' tender and melancholic sentiments.<br><br></td>

                        This is an exercise in "point, line, and plane" that I practiced. The original piece was initially colored with colored pencils, but I did not retain a final photo of the finished product.</td>
