            Running is my favorite exercise. During the process, I always empty my mind and simply enjoy the sensation of the wind blowing, which brings relaxation to both body and mind.<br><br>Gradually increasing the distance of my runs from just a few hundred meters to several kilometers stemmed from a charity event in high school. During this event, each participant ran a lap around the school track, and for each lap completed, the Dong Foundation donated a sum of money to charity. Over time, I grew fond of the feeling of gradually increasing distances. Moreover, running is one of the simplest exercises, allowing me to completely clear my mind and relieve stress.
            <br><br>In the past two years, I have set my sights on the long-distance events at our university's annual sports meet to gauge my progress. This process has been about exploring concepts of "winning" and "achievements." Initially, I was driven by a strong desire to win, which motivated me to continually extend my training distances and improve my average speed in pursuit of better rankings and personal bests. However, as time went on, I realized that my underlying fear was actually of losing and not enjoying the feeling of failure.<br><br>Nevertheless, as I continued to run, my perspective shifted. I came to realize that I only needed to showcase my achievements to myself. The most valuable aspect of it all was the process of running itself, which brought relaxation to my body, mind, and spirit.
